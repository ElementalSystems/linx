The Internationalization package. This package provides you with some utilities that will help you
on your internationalization tasks.

There's no intention for this library to contain translations for other languages.

### I18NString

The I18NString is a String representation that can be translated. This string can be a plain String or
a lodash template.

This implementation creates a clear separation between the translation mechanism and it's internal logic. This package is used across the library in order to provide I18N out of the box!

**Constructor**

* `new I18N.String(message, data?, translations?)`
<br />
Creates a String instance with the given *message*, associated *data*, and an object which contain the *translation*.

**Methods**

* `.toString(translations?)`
<br />
Gets the string representation of the error. If _translations_ object is provided the message Error message will try to be translated.

**Example**

```js

{%= _.include("I18N/I18NStringDocExample.js") %}

```
